# Checkout Repo

This repo is the source of my code, that I check out during a CircleCI pipeline. You'll notice that there are no CircleCI config files here, because now CircleCI config files don't need to live in the same place as the source code. Cool!

The CircleCI config files live here: `https://github.com/jenny-miggin/config-repo`
